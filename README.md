## Corellium Utility Scripts

A collection of scripts written in `JavaScript` designed to interact with the [Corellium API](https://corellium.github.io/corellium-api/) with the aim of facilitating pentesting activities.

Currently comprises of:

- `sslPinning.js`: Allows querying the current `status` of SSL pinning as well as switching SSL pinning `on`/`off`.
- `takeScreenshot.js`: Facilitates screenshot taking by directly dropping screenshots within the local `screenshots` folder.

## Installation

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2. Download this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aress31/corellium-utils
   cd .\corellium-utils
   ```
 
3. Install the dependencies:

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The command below is to be executed in the root folder of this project.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create an `.env` file in the root folder containing the following constants:

   > [!NOTE]
   > Replace the placeholder values with your values.

   ```
   API_TOKEN="XXX"
   ENDPOINT="https://app.corellium.com"
   INSTANCE="XXX"
   PROJECT="Default Project"
   ```

## Usage

- To take a screenshot:

  ```bash
  node .\takeScreenshot.js
  ```

- To query the `status` of SSL pinning:

  ```bash
  node .\sslPinning.js -c status
  ```

- To `enable` SSL pinning bypass:

  ```bash
  node .\sslPinning.js -c enable
  ```

- To `disable` SSL pinning bypass:

  ```bash
  node .\sslPinning.js -c disable
  ```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Improve the `argparsing` logic.
- [ ] Merge the scripts into a master script with more function modularity, e.g., `login`.
- [ ] Automate proxying to Burp Suite, so far it seems that the current version of the [Corellium API](https://corellium.github.io/corellium-api/) does not export any function that could enable us implementing this feature.
- [ ] Implement additional features - open to suggestions.
